# 🧮 Prevailing Interest Calculator

A simple and intuitive Streamlit web app to calculate the estimated interest earned from a **High Yield Savings Plus Account** based on user-inputted deposit amount and duration.

## 📌 Project Overview

This calculator helps users estimate their interest earnings over a specified time period using tiered interest rates:

- **First $50,000** → 1.5% p.a.
- **Next $25,000** → 1.6% p.a.
- **Next $25,000** → 1.8% p.a.
- **Amount over $100,000** → 2.0% p.a.

The app computes the interest based on the number of days between a user-specified start and end date.
